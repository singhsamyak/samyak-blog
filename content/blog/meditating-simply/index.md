Meditation is not complex. It does not require apps, music, or chants. It does not demand a religious belief. It does not need serene landscapes, tall mountains, or surreal sunrises. It surely does not expect us to be a Buddha.

Meditation is simple. It is designed to help us discipline our minds and teach us how to let go of our thoughts. By letting go, we can transcend into a more liberated version of ourselves.

## Meditating

### Sitting

Sit on the floor or on a chair, as long as your back is comfortable and upright. Our spines are naturally curved, so don’t force your back to be straight. Place your hands on your lap or on your knees, whichever is comfortable. Let go of all expressions. Close your eyes. Breathe.

### Breathing

Breathe normally. No long breaths, no holding it in, and nothing forceful. Breathing is the most important aspect of meditation. Feel the breath that enters and exits your nostrils. Focus on it.

Keep your mind empty as long as you can. This is challenging. Our minds are wild and will constantly entertain a plethora of thoughts. One moment it is creative and ecstatic, the next it might be anxious and depressing.

Don’t react to these thoughts. Don’t be pleased by the positive ones, or disturbed by the negative. Instead, notice that they are present and go back to focusing on your breath. Remain composed. Be neutral. Repeat this cycle of going from breathing, to acknowledging, to breathing again. Remember that the goal is to keep your mind empty, both from the pleasant and the grotesque thoughts.

## Letting Go

By doing nothing but breathing, we are letting our minds be in their natural and most vulnerable state. We are voluntarily choosing to be alone with our untamed self.

By observing a thought take refuge in our mind, we are able to own it. Because we own it, we can let it go. By going back to breathing, we let go of what dwells inside us. It may come back, but now we control it.

Meditation teaches us about the need to let go of our thoughts, and the power of being equanimous. It gives us authority over what harbors in our conscience. It allows us to be a master of our thoughts instead of being enslaved by them. It allows us to be in harmony with ourselves.

Letting go is imperative. Even breath, the most fundamental element of life, needs to be let go. We take it in, we live it, and we let it go. That’s how we stay alive. By breathing. By letting go.
