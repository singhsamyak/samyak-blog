description: The unforgettable fragments of my trip.

I’ve always remembered moments of my travel through photos. I capture them throughout the course of my trip, and upload them on my website so I can look back at the memories. However, I realized that some fragments of time get lost because it’s not possible to take photos of them. So, this time, I wrote about them instead.

These were my favorite moments in Austin, over a weekend:

- Being entranced by a local band at Maggie May’s as they covered songs like Crazy and Clint Eastwood, and then dancing with strangers who had nothing in common with me but their love for live-music and dancing.

- Rowing a kayak in the pitch-black darkness of the Colorado River, hearing only the sound of water being paddled by our oars. Tiring and therapeutic at the same time.

- Taking a shot for friends who just became parents.

- Swimming the length of the cold, three-acre long Barton Springs pool.

- Pigging out on delicious pork ribs at Micklethwait Craft Meats under a small tent, while it was raining all around us. No line, no hassle. Just BBQ, Pepsi, and raindrops.

- Sipping a cocktail at the bar inside a large, empty banquet hall with nobody else but a Moroccan bartender, talking about pregnant bats that fly from Mexico, the Berber language, Pablo Escobar, firmness of mattresses, and everything in between.

Go visit Austin, it’s electrifying!
