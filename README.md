This is my personal blog, forked from [Gatsby blog starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog), inspired by Dan Abramov's [personal blog](https://overreacted.io/) and Medium's UI design. This is where I will share thoughts on Javascript, life, and everything in between.

To run locally:

```
yarn && yarn start
```
